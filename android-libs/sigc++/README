libsigc++ -- The Typesafe Callback Framework for C++


General information:

   libsigc++ implements a typesafe callback system for standard C++. It
   allows you to define signals and to connect those signals to any
   callback function, either global or a member function, regardless of
   whether it is static or virtual.

   libsigc++ is used by gtkmm to wrap the GTK+ signal system. It does not
   depend on GTK+ or gtkmm.

   Further information is available on the libsigc++ project home page:

Compatibility:

   Compatible compilers must supports the following C++ techniques:
   * Partial template (class) specialization.
   * Explicit template (member) function instantiation.
   * Treat void return as normal return.

   All releases are tested with the gcc compiler.
   Release 2.3.2 has been tested with gcc 4.8.2, clang 3.4 and MS Visual C++ 2010.
   It should also compile with:
   * gcc >= 3.2
   * cygwin (gcc >= 3.2)
   * mingw32
   * Microsoft Visual Studio .Net 2003
   * Sun Forte C++ compiler >= 5.5
   * Compaq C++ compiler
   * Intel compiler
   Please report any troubles you encounter with these compilers!
   You are also invited to try a compiler that is not listed above.
