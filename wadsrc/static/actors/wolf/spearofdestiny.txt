/* Spear of Destiny
 *
 * This is not quite an inventory item in the traditional sense as it merely
 * uses the code to detect pickup.  When the player touches the item, it sets
 * the victory flag to true and jumps to the Pickup state. The Spear is the
 * only item that ticks during this phase and is never actually inserted into
 * the player's inventory.
 *
 * The victory flag is reset when the item is destroyed. The only clean way to
 * do this is to warp the player to a new map.
